1. using jupyter notebook of google colab
2. using comments
3. using numerical operations + - * / // % **
4. using numpy, importing
5. numpy function examples-1:
    sin, cos, exp, log with numbers
6. data types in numpy: int, float [check for unsigned int and double], bool, str
7. variables and using above functions, typecasting
8. input and output: input and print

    aa = input()
    print (aa)
9. copy variables in python
10. operations with variables
11. containers: mutable, not mutable... list, tuple, array
   mutable: can be changed
   list: mutable, ordered, heterogenious
   tuple: nonmutable, ordered, heterogenious
   array: mutable, ordered, homogenious

12. basic list operations: indexing, append, extend, insert, remove,
   index, len, multiply
13. more list operations as homework: concatenate, count, sort
14. basic array operations: add, multiply, 1D, 2D, index, slicing
15. basic oeprations with string
16. conditional and for loop
17. reading from a file, writing to a file.
18. look at the problem 1-4.
29. look at the problem 5. [find squared numbers in between 1 and 10,00,000]

Home work problem:

1. Find all the pairs of numbers that add to 1000.
2. Find all the triplets of numbers that add to 1000.
3. Find all the prime numbers to 1000.
