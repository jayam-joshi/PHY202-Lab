1. Define a list with elements list1=[1,2,3,4,5]. Try following operations.
    list1*3, list1*3.14, list1**2, list*pi
2. Define another list but elements are strings list2=['a','b','c'].
   Try following
   list1+list2, list1*list2 
3. Define an array with following entries aa=[1,2,3,4,5] and try the
   operations 1-2. 
What do you conclude from these?

4. A list of mid-semester and end semester marks as obtained by the
   students of the PHY202 course in the year 1900 is given in the file
   L1CD11.txt. The highest mark in the mid-semester examination was 50
   and that in the end semester was 100. It was decided that 40% marks
   from the mid-semester and 60% from the end semester will be used to
   grade the students. The grades are to be given from 1 to 10 having a
   linear relation with their marks such that a person with greater than
   80% gets a grade of 9 etc. The pass grade was 7.

   (a) Find the grades of the students.
   (b) Print the roll number, name and grade of the students.

   The students with roll numbers 19005 and 19002 did not have 75% of
   attendance and hence their grades were 0.

   (c) Print the roll number, name and grade of the students with the modified grades.
   (d) Print the roll number, name and grade of the students who failed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PSUDO CODE:
1. Import the numpy library.
2. Read data from the text file and put  into arrays of students, rollno, 
   midsem and endsemmarks.
3. Typecast required data to floating point.
4. Calculate the grade:
   	    Marks = (40.*(MidSem/50.) + 60.*(EndSem/100.))/10.
	    Grade = convert it to 1 to 10
5. Print the grades.
6. Change the Grades to the students with less attendances.
7. Find the index of the array that points to students with grades less than 7.
8. Print the grades etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Find all the square numbers between 1 and 1000.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PSUDO CODE:
0. create an empty list
1. run loop between 1 and 100
2. calculate the square of the number
3. convert it to nearest integer and find the difference between those
4. if the difference is zero, append the list
5. once outside the loop print the list
